# Graphs depicting Plus and Minus Signal and the resultant Comparator Circuit without amplifier stage and with amplifier stage
**Note: This will be upgraded and this graph is not final output graph**

</p>

• Note that the difference between the plus and minus signal is as low as 1mV

## Differential Output of Comparator which is able to compare with no Circuit Trimming

**Differential output without amplification**

• Above image is one isolated values of DIFFOUT_N and ADJ. Note that the Comparator is able to detect and differentiate the signal but the signal doesnt have enough strength to be detected by logic circuits.

**Differential output with amplification**

• Note the Plus, Minus Signal and Amplified Differential Output.
