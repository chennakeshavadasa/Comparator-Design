# Comparator-Design
o	Designed a Comparator that detects differential signals as low as ± 1mV.
o	Simulated the Design with device mismatch parameters and operating temperature of -40°C to 125°C.
o	Ensured Self calibration with no circuit trimming and Sensing time of 1μsec calibration and 1μsec sensing (no speed optimization)
