# Comparator Design using Skywater130
Note: This is an ongoing project so might contain errors
## Overview

This repository contains the design and simulation files for a high-performance Comparator capable of detecting differential signals as low as ±1mV. The design is self-calibrating, eliminating the need for circuit trimming, and achieves a sensing time of 1μsec for both calibration and sensing, without speed optimization.

## Features

- **High Sensitivity:** Detects differential signals as low as ±1mV.
  
- **Wide Temperature Range:** Simulated for operation from -40°C to 125°C to ensure robust performance in various environments.
  
- **Self-Calibration:** No need for circuit trimming, providing a hassle-free calibration process.
  
- **Fast Sensing Time:** Achieves a sensing time of 1μsec for both calibration and sensing, meeting stringent speed requirements.

## Simulation

The design has been thoroughly simulated, taking into account device mismatch parameters and the specified operating temperature range. The simulation results demonstrate the reliability and performance of the Comparator under varying conditions.
